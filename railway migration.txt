⏺ Perfect choice! Railway is much better for your medical document processing needs. Here's your migration plan:

  🚀 Railway Migration Instructions

  Step 1: Sign Up & Setup

  1. Go to https://railway.app/
  2. Sign up with your GitHub account
  3. Connect your existing repository: falconway/strivefitweb

  Step 2: Deploy Setup

  1. Create New Project → Deploy from GitHub
  2. Select your repo → strivefitweb
  3. Framework: Node.js (Railway will auto-detect)
  4. Root Directory: Leave empty (uses project root)

  Step 3: Environment Variables

  Add these in Railway Dashboard → Settings → Environment:
  OPENROUTER_API_KEY=your_openrouter_key
  OPENROUTER_MODEL=google/gemini-flash-1.5
  BLOB_READ_WRITE_TOKEN=your_blob_token
  NODE_ENV=production

  Step 4: Database/Storage

  - Keep Vercel Blob for file storage (works from anywhere)
  - Keep JSON accounts system for now
  - Railway provides Redis/Postgres if needed later

  Step 5: Domain Setup

  - Railway gives you: yourapp.railway.app
  - Custom domain: Add your domain in Railway settings
  - SSL: Automatic (like Vercel)

  Step 6: Code Changes

  - Remove Vercel-specific code (function timeouts, etc.)
  - Keep OpenRouter integration - will work better on Railway
  - Increase timeouts - Railway handles long-running processes

  Expected Benefits:

  - ✅ No timeout issues - Persistent services
  - ✅ Chinese access - Good Asia performance
  - ✅ Reliable processing - No function limitations
  - ✅ $5/month - Predictable costs

  Ready to migrate? It should be much smoother than fighting Vercel's limitations!

⏺ Perfect! Using Railway's own storage will simplify everything and keep it all in one place. Here's the complete migration plan:

  🚀 Railway Migration with Railway Storage

  Step 1: Railway Setup

  1. Go to https://railway.app/
  2. Sign up with GitHub
  3. Create New Project → Deploy from GitHub
  4. Select falconway/strivefitweb

  Step 2: Add Railway Storage

  1. In Railway Dashboard → Add Service → Volume
  2. Mount Path: /app/storage
  3. Size: 5GB (expandable)
  4. This gives you persistent file storage

  Step 3: Environment Variables

  OPENROUTER_API_KEY=your_openrouter_key
  OPENROUTER_MODEL=google/gemini-flash-1.5
  RAILWAY_STORAGE_PATH=/app/storage
  NODE_ENV=production
  PORT=3000

  Step 4: Code Changes for Railway Storage

  Replace Vercel Blob with Railway file system:
  - Accounts: /app/storage/accounts.json
  - Uploaded files: /app/storage/uploads/[account]/[filename]
  - Processed files: /app/storage/processed/[account]/[filename]

  Step 5: Storage Structure

  /app/storage/
  ├── accounts.json
  ├── uploads/
  │   └── 50-63-85-6521-18-4989/
  │       └── [uploaded-files]
  └── processed/
      └── 50-63-85-6521-18-4989/
          └── [processed-files]

  Benefits of Railway Storage:

  - ✅ No blob complexity - Simple file system
  - ✅ Persistent storage - Survives deployments
  - ✅ No external dependencies - Everything in Railway
  - ✅ Chinese access - Direct file serving
  - ✅ Better performance - No external API calls

  Next Steps:

  1. Set up Railway with the above config
  2. I'll help you migrate the storage code in our next conversation
  3. Test with Chinese clients - should work perfectly

  Ready to proceed? Railway + Railway Storage will be much more reliable than Vercel Blob! 🎯
